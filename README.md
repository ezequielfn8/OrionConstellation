# OrionConstellation
Matplotlib project, with a 2D and a 3D graph

This CodeCademy challenge allowed me to show my new skills in matplotlib, creating a 2D graph and also a 3D graph about the Orion Constellation. Fell free to watch and to give me any feedback you want!

Note: the 3D graph is rotatable, but this is not available in GitHub.
